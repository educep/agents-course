# Code Review Assessment üìö

This feedback should help you improve your skills.

> ‚õîÔ∏è The feedback uses Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct to compare your response to a gold standard solution. As we know, LLMs are not perfect. You should compare your work against the assessment criteria if you doubt the feedback.

## Question 1: Create a Basic Code Agent with Web Search Capability

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Create a CodeAgent with DuckDuckGo search capability
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

# Initialize the search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()
model = HfApiModel(
    max_tokens=2096,
    temperature=0.5,
    model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",
    custom_role_conversions=None,
)

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],  # Add search tool here
    model=model,  # Add model here
)
```

**Reference Solution:**
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

    FinalAnswerTool,
)

model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct", provider="together")
# Create web agent and manager agent structure
web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[
        GoogleSearchTool(provider="serper"),
        VisitWebpageTool(),
    ],  # Add required tools
    model=model,  # Add model
    max_steps=5,  # Adjust steps
    name="web_agent",
    description="Browses the web to find information",
)

manager_model = HfApiModel("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1", provider="together")
manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    model=manager_model,
    managed_agents=[web_agent],
    tools=[FinalAnswerTool()],
    additional_authorized_imports=[
        "json",
        "pandas",
        "numpy",
    ],
    planning_interval=5,
    verbosity_level=2,
    max_steps=15,
)

manager_agent.run("find me the best places to visit in the world")
```

**Reference Solution:**
```python
web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), visit_webpage],
    model=model,
    max_steps=10,
    name="search",
    description="Runs web searches for you."
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    managed_agents=[web_agent],
    additional_authorized_imports=["time", "numpy", "pandas"]
)
```

### Assessment Criteria:
- Web agent has correct tools configured
- Manager agent properly references web agent

- **Manager agent properly references web agent**
  ‚úÖ The manager agent correctly references the web agent in its managed_agents list.

- **Appropriate max_steps value is set**
  ‚ùå The web agent has a max_steps value of 5, which might be too low for complex tasks. The manager agent has a max_steps value of 15, which is reasonable.

- **Required imports are authorized**
  ‚úÖ The manager agent authorizes the necessary imports: json, pandas, and numpy.

## Question 3: Configure Agent Security Settings

**Your Solution:**
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, E2BSandbox

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[], model=model, sandbox=E2BSandbox(), additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"]
)
```

**Reference Solution:**
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, E2BSandbox

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    sandbox=E2BSandbox(),
    additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"]
)
```

### Assessment Criteria:
- E2B sandbox is properly configured
- Authorized imports are appropriately limited
- Security settings are correctly implemented
- Basic agent configuration is maintained

### Feedback:
**Overall Assessment**

The student's solution is identical to the reference solution, which means it meets all the assessment criteria.

## Question 4: Implement a Tool-Calling Agent

**Your Solution:**
```python
# External imports
from smolagents import (
    DuckDuckGoSearchTool,
    VisitWebpageTool,
    ToolCallingAgent,
    HfApiModel,
)

    max_steps=5,
    "name"="tool_calling_agent",
    "description"="Agent can visit WebPages",
)

agent.run(
    "Search for the best music recommendations for a party at the Wayne's mansion."
)
```

**Reference Solution:**
```python
from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent

agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[custom_tool],
    model=model,
